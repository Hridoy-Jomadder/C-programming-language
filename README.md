                                                               Introduction to C Programming Language:

C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has a concise syntax and provides low-level access to memory, making it suitable for system programming and embedded systems. C is widely used in various applications, including operating systems, game development, and application software.



Key features of C include:
1. Procedural Language: C follows a procedural programming paradigm, where the program is structured into procedures (functions) that execute sequentially.

2. Efficient Memory Management: C allows direct manipulation of pointers, providing efficient memory management and access to hardware-level functionalities.

3. Portability: C programs can be easily ported across different platforms with minimal modifications.

4. Powerful Standard Library: C comes with a rich set of standard libraries that provide functions for tasks like I/O operations, string manipulation, memory allocation, etc.
